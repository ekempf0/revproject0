# revproject0
This is our first project for Revature. A simple command-line terminal program to demonstrate the use of databases and database interactions. 

Using Python, PyMongo, and MongoDB, I created an Automotive Sales application that accepted logins for three types of users, Managers, Employees, and Customers.

Each user had their own functionalities and capabilities, with each being able to perform some if not all of the CRUD operations upon my database.

KC Auto is the program, and Kcaf are the menu functions (to demonstrate the separation of the functions from the main).
